 # gather data
  # decide how to annotate images fast/best
   # build a web application for crowdsourcing?
   # what information do we need?
 # come up with good features
  # color - ponies have distinctive colors. sometimes this does not hold true.
  # cutie mark - a 2d image - easy, all invariances are known
  # shape? - not very good on its own as many ponies share the same model, but crucial for bw images and recolors. also, how do we deal with humanized mlp?
  # remember: we donâ€™t have to do this if we have lots of data and computing power. but we donâ€™t.
  # color histogram
  # neural net + sliding windows?
   # whatâ€™s the smallest possible pony?
 # implement the system
  # choose platform vs cross platform
  # modularity
  # use cases and applications
   # automatic organization of the pony folder
   # pony tineye
   # automatic transcription of episodes
  # what is the pipeline?
   # hisrogram -> sliding window -> neural net
